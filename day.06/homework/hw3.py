#Debugging is the identification and resolution of existing and potential issues in software or hardware. Examples of these issues include faulty code (such as source code with logic errors) and manufacturing defects. The debugging process typically involves three steps:


#Identifying bugs. During the first stage of the debugging process, end users, quality assurance (QA) testers, and developers report bugs. They may find these problems through processes like unit tests, manual code reviews, or simply by using the software or device. Some integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Visual Studio, offer built-in debugging tools to analyze lines of code step by step.

#Analyzing bugs. At this phase, the reported bugs from step one will be evaluated. Important elements to consider include how the bug impacts the functionality and which parts of the software or hardware will be affected by it. Bugs can be caused by many types of errors, including syntax errors, logical errors, and runtime errors. The developers then prioritize bug fixes and create an action plan and timeline for fixing.

#Fixing bugs and preparing for the future. Once the bugs have been fixed, software development professionals and QA testers ensure the software will continue to work properly by running tests. They also plan future tests to more easily identify recurring bugs.

#Sometimes, software tools that come with features to aid users in debugging techniques are called debuggers.
