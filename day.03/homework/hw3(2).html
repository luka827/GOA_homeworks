<!-- 
HTML Elements: 
These are the basic building blocks used to create content on web pages. 
Elements can include text, images, buttons, and more, forming the structure of a website.
 
Tags: 
In HTML, tags are indicated by angle brackets, for example, <p> for paragraphs 
or <h1> for headings. Tags describe how a particular element should look and behave.

Opening Tag: 
This is the tag that indicates the start of an element. 
For example, <div> is an opening tag that signifies the beginning of a new section.

Closing Tag: 
This is the tag that indicates the end of an element. 
For example, </div> is a closing tag that shows that the section is finished. 
Every opening tag should have a corresponding closing tag, except for empty tags.

Empty Tag: 
This is a tag that doesn't require a closing tag because it has no content. 
For example, <img> (for images) and <br> (for line breaks and you can use <div></div> too...) are empty tags.

Using these elements and tags correctly is essential for creating functional (js)
and visually appealing web pages,sites.
